<i>2018-09-15</i><p>TL;DR: Exploiting cPickle &amp; Bad Pip Permissions. | This was yet another very well-crafted box, largely because there was minimal guesswork required. While sometimes it can take forever to guess your way through a system, this one was very logical, and as such, fun to do. [<a href="https://medium.com/ctf-writeups/canape-write-up-htb-exploiting-cpickle-bad-pip-permissions-d04f101e0228?source=rss-17e8908ba466------2" target="_blank">Read More...</a>]</p>

<i>2018-09-15</i><p>TL;DR: Escalating privileges through an SSH Tunnel. | Although Poison is largely considered as one of the easier boxes on the platform, I found root fairly hard to obtain, since I spent a few hours following a dead-end. Despite this, I ended up learning more about more niche areas of VNC and SSH tunnelling that I knew very little of before.

<i>2018-09-15</i><p>TL;DR: Node.js Serialization Vulnerabilities. | Celestial was a really fun box to do, since it was very well-structured and there was little guesswork involved. Although the priv-esc was a simple root crontab exploit, I learnt a lot about serialization vulnerabilities whilst getting the user flag.

<i>2018-09-15</i><p>TL;DR: Heartbleed &amp; Dirty COW. | I found Valentine to be really fun, because for me it served as an excuse to get to grips with two of (what I consider to be) the most iconic vulnerabilities that I know. This was only the third box that I completed on the platform, and so some of the techniques that I may have used whilst originally creating the following write-up may seem a little different to those found in some of my other write-ups.

<i>2018-09-15</i><p>TL;DR: RCE through XXE. | For me, this box was great because unlike some others there wasn’t much to guess, and instead it was simply logical.

<i>2018-09-15</i><p>TL;DR: Default Creds and Broken Sudo. | Nibbles was the very first system that I completed, and although it was undoubtedly one of the easiest boxes, I found it to be a solid starting point as I got to grips with the platform.

<i>2018-09-15</i><p>TL;DR: Abusing CACLS. | For some strange reason, it took me far longer to recreate my steps in order to create this write-up than it did to complete the box the first-time round. I found this system particularly infuriating due to its constant resets and crashes, but despite this, I feel like I’ve still learnt a lot from it.
