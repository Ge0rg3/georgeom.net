The website that I attacked was a new CTF hosting provider, and I had actually participated in a CTF using this provider prior to being invited to their private program. Please note that as the program is private, I can\u2019t show the exact pages exploited, or show any of the exact code that I used to exploit them. Out of all bugs submitted, I believe that this had the highest severity."}, {"title": "BLK_BOX Challenge Write-up", "link": "https://medium.com/ctf-writeups/blk-box-challenge-write-up-abc9a091142c?source=rss-17e8908ba466------2", "date": "Sun, 16 Feb 2020 15:50:19 GMT", "preview": "Around 6 months ago,  HMGCC  released a challenge and offered a challenge coin to anyone who completed it.

You can find the homepage for this CTF  here In this write-up, I\u2019m only going to go over the challenges that I solved during the competition, going from what I found to be the easiest to the hardest. I made a deal with Hulch Hogan (Hulk Hogan's brother) for a treasure map can you get the treaure for me? In this challenge, we were given a text file with the following contents: CMM72222+22 CQC52222+22 CH9J2222+22 9H9M2222+22 8PQ42222+22 9P4G2222+22 8Q572222+22 After a quick bit of Googling, I found that these were  plus codes However, they all pointed to different oceans/deserts with little other information: Google Maps results for each plus code."}, {"title": "StegOnline: A New Steganography Tool", "link": "https://medium.com/ctf-writeups/stegonline-a-new-steganography-tool-b4eddb8f8f57?source=rss-17e8908ba466------2", "date": "Fri, 05 Apr 2019 01:01:17 GMT", "preview": "Over the last couple of months, I have been developing an online image Steganography tool designed to combine and enhance the features of other separate tools.

It\u2019s clear that it was popular, since it wasn\u2019t voted out for so long. The main attack vectors in this were SQL Injection through the login field, and then escaping through cleartext passwords in the Windows Subsystem for Linux. PART ONE: USER Let\u2019s begin with an nmap scan: nmap -sV -sC -oN nmap.log 10.10.10.97 It seems like there are only two services running on this box:  HTTP  &  SMB We can also see that the webserver is running Microsoft IIS, which is definitely important to note."}, {"title": "Waldo Write-up (HTB)", "link": "https://medium.com/ctf-writeups/waldo-write-up-htb-dfbaaaa91282?source=rss-17e8908ba466------2", "date": "Sat, 15 Dec 2018 17:44:48 GMT", "preview": "As opposed to the more generic two-stage boxes, Waldo was unique in that there were three challenges to overcome, and each had completely different methods needed to do so. Whilst the third stage was a little tedious and hard to explain, I learnt about some small Linux functions that I never knew existed before. PART ONE: USER The usual nmap scan reveals three open ports: Click  here  to view a breakdown of this command.
