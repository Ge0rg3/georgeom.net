        <h5>Breaking the Competition (Bug Bounty Write-up)</h5>
        <p><i>Wednesday, 15th January 2020</i></p>
        <p>In this post, I'll be describing how I found 5 bugs on a private HackerOne program. The website that I attacked was a new CTF hosting provider, and I had actually participated in a CTF using this provider prior to being invited to their private program.</p>

        <h5>BLK_BOX Challenge Write-up</h5>
        <p><i>Wednesday, 15th January 2020</i></p>
        <p>Around 6 months ago, HMGCC released a challenge and offered a challenge coin to anyone who completed it. I started pretty late on, but managed to get it done in time. This consisted of 7 stages, ranging from reverse engineering to traffic analysis. At the time of writing, you can still have a go yourself here.</p>

        <h5>Sunshine CTF 2019 Write-up</h5>

        <p>At the end of March this year, Hack@UCF released a CTF in collaboration with BSides Orlando 2019. Our team ended up coming 13th, narrowly missing out on a top 10 spot. You can find the homepage for this CTF here.</p>

        <h5>StegOnline: A New Steganography Tool</h5>
        <p><i>Wednesday, 15th January 2020</i></p>
        <p>Over the last couple of months, I have been developing an online image Steganography tool designed to combine and enhance the features of other separate tools. It's open-source and due to the nature of Angular, it's easy to add to.</p>
