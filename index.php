                        Hi! I'm a computer science and cybersecurity enthusiast, currently working as a Technology Degree Apprentice at Accenture UK.

                    <p>
                        This blog mostly covers bug bounty and CTF write-ups, to document my work over time.

                <p><i>Wednesday, 15th January 2020</i></p>
                <p>In this post, I'll be describing how I found 5 bugs on a private HackerOne program. The website that I attacked was a new CTF hosting provider, and I had actually participated in a CTF using this provider prior to being invited to their private program.</p>
